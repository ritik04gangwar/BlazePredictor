## Project Overview

BlazePredictor aims to mitigate forest fire risks by using predictive analytics to forecast fire-prone conditions. The system integrates various data sources and machine learning algorithms to deliver timely predictions and alerts.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses historical fire data and environmental variables to predict fire risks.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Processes real-time data for immediate risk assessment.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive platform for users to interact with the system and view predictions.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Sends automated alerts for high-risk conditions.

## Installation

To get started with BlazePredictor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlazePredictor.git
    cd BlazePredictor
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Place your data files in the `data` directory.
   - Update the file paths in `config.py` if necessary.

2. **Train the Model:**

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Run the Prediction:**

    ```bash
    python predict.py --input data/test_data.csv
    ```

4. **View Results:**
   - The predictions will be saved in the `results` directory.

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing the model is `forestfires.csv`. It includes the following columns:

- `X`, `Y`: Coordinates of the fire.
- `month`, `day`: Date information.
- `FFMC`, `DMC`, `DC`, `ISI`: Fire weather indices.
- `temp`, `RH`, `wind`, `rain`: Weather conditions.
- `area`: Area affected by the fire.

## Model Training

The project uses a deep learning model implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. The key steps in model training are:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for training.
2. **Model Architecture:** Define the neural network layers and compile the model.
3. **Training:** Fit the model on the training data and evaluate on validation data.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE). The evaluation results help in tuning the model and improving accuracy.

## Future Work

- **Enhance Model Accuracy:** Implement advanced algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Expand Data Sources:** Integrate additional environmental and satellite data.
- **Improve Real-Time Processing:** Develop capabilities for real-time data analysis and alerting.
- **User Feedback:** Collect and implement feedback to refine the user interface and features.
